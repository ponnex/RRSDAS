# Remote Rain and Stream Data Acquisition System Progressive Web App

Remote Rain and Stream Data Acquisition System is a monitoring system for stream potentiality in developing potential site for micro hydro power plant and it can also serve as an early warning system for flash floods. The system has a device that will be installed on the ground which is meters away from the stream. The device then monitors the velocity of the stream as well as the rain flow and all other necessary data needed. The study aims to develop a Progressive Web Application, develop code for the interfacing of data from the module to the Raspberry PI. The limited number of client that can receive data and adding another client manually on site became the problem of the system. 

The system has one SMS server which has two main functions which is to receive data from SMS and save it in the database through a cloud database. The data saved from the database are used to display graphical data. From the module it will transmit text messages to the server, from the server the text messages will be converted and will be sending to the cloud which will be displayed to the different devices.
As a result, the system functions successfully. The modules where able to transmit data to the server and the user can view data for the stream and rain flow monitored from the modules specific site.
